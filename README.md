CloudStack Client Generator
===========================

### DEPRECATED ###

This project has been merged into the client project [leprechau/cloudstack-php-client](https://github.com/leprechau/cloudstack-php-client) as we are now using the CloudStack API function ```listApis``` instead of scraping HTML to generate the client libraries.

Many thanks to the parent fork of this project for making the path to a 4.3+ compliant PHP API much simpler.
